Hi! I’m Ada, a big fan of Baymax from *Big Hero 6* and a final-year research master’s student aiming for a PhD in social robotics starting Fall 2026. I’m fascinated by how people perceive and interact with social robots.

Right now, I’m a research intern on a robots and social influence project led by Professor Jochen Peter, where I program multiple [NAO](https://aldebaran.com/en/nao6/) robots, my tiny “colleagues” who never complain (well, almost).

Also, I just finished my second read of Kate Darling’s [*The New Breed*](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/309409/the-new-breed-by-darling-kate/9780141988641). If you’re into social robots, feel free to reach out, I’d love to chat!
